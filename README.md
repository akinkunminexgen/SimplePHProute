# SimplePHProute
This is a simple php route

This is a simple example of a PHP router that maps URL routes to specific actions or views. The router uses namespaces to organize different parts of the application.

### Middleware
To use middleware in the Route::group, it must be the same name as the filename (.php), so as to execute the task needed

# No dependencies
This simply uses the core php (without any library) by using the Routes class defined in this project and other relevant classes etc. with the aid of autoloading to properly configure all classes.
